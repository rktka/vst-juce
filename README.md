# vst-juce
Collection of custom DAW VSTs written with the JUCE C++ framework

Try out the current version of the plugin in a 32 or 64 bit DAW with the .vst3 files in the main directory. They have been tested with FL Studio 12 but any DAW with vst3 support should work (Cubase, Presonus, Studio One, etc.)
